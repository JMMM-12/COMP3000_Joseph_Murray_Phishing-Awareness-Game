### Project Title: Anti Phisher

### Project Vision
Children are becoming increasingly exposed to phishing emails, which attempt to trick them into divulging sensitive information, performing financial transfers, or downloading malware. Unfortunately, children are especially susceptible to phishing due to their limited cybersecurity awareness, curiosity, and naivety, making them a favourable target for social engineers.

Anti Phisher aims to solve this problem by providing children (ages 8-13) with an engaging mobile-based learning game where they are taught how to recognize and respond to phishing emails. This is achieved through satisfying gameplay whereby players interact with simulated emails to identify phishing indicators and select suitable responses. Additionally, this gameplay is supported with dialogue teachings and visual feedback to aid the playerâ€™s learning.

This game equips children with essential practical skills in phishing awareness and mitigation to minimize their exposure to phishing. This ensures that children are much safer when interacting with email platforms and that parents can be assured that their children are better protected from the dangers of phishing. Moreover, having obtained this fundamental knowledge during childhood, children will be much more capable of defending themselves against phishing emails in the future.

In comparison to existing internet safety games such as Interland and Cyber Land, Anti Phisher exclusively focuses on phishing, opting for a more specialized and tailored educational approach rather than one that considers all cornerstones of internet safety.
