### Project Title: Anti_Phisher

### Project Vision
With the ever-increasing threat and effectiveness of phishing attacks, combined with the rise in access to technology, particularly for younger ages, children are much more prone to these attacks.

My phishing awareness game, ‘Anti-Phisher’, aims to protect children between the ages of 8-13 from the dangers of phishing attacks. This will be delivered as a highly interactive and engaging learning platform, whereby users would play through levels of increasingly difficult decision-based phishing challenges and minigames that teach them how to spot phishing attacks, how to deal with them, and the consequences of falling for such an attack. Within this, users will be tested on their phishing knowledge through a series of simulated phishing scenarios. Accompanying these features will be a reward system with various reward methods to keep users incentivized.

By educating children about this key cybersecurity issue, both academically and practically, they will be more equipped to defend themselves from phishing attacks now and in the future. Moreover, by making this educational process engaging and enjoyable through gamification, children are more likely to engage with the game’s content.

Unlike one existing alternative Interland, my game will feature simulated phishing scenarios, giving the user practice against phishing attacks that can be applied to real-world scenarios. My game also differs from another key competition Cyber Games UK, since it features a variety of reward aspects to incentivize users who are uninterested in cybersecurity before playing the game.
